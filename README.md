Hello Programmers

I have faced the problem of chaos in my hard disk and a messy of non organized files and folders;
and it is known that the environment affects on the person’s productivity. 
Since our works is done in the digital realm, so we must start from organizing ours Machine’s (PC or Laptops) hard disks. 

In this repository I uploaded suggested folder structure to organize chaos in hard disk scpecially for developer.

Steps:

1-	Clean out old and unnecessary files including redundant programs, old tutorial and repeated files and so on.

2-	Choose a root folder for the structure carefully as you want (Home directory in linux or any drivers) and unzip the compressed file.

3-  Organize your files


Notes:

1-	Temp folder will contains a temp of non organized files and you must organize them periodically. 

2-	The “Work” folder contains Companies I worked or work now with its Projects and 
    every project contains the “Source” code of project and its “Documents”. 

3-	CS folder stands for “computer science” it contains programming languages, Databases, 
    Operating systems and folder “Topics” which holds the topics you may interest such as Algorithms, Computer Vision and Neural Networks.

4-	Other folders related to your non career aspect such as films and personal data.

5-	You can change this structure to fit your needs either add or remove. For example you can use “Work” folder
    and another folder called “Personal” which combines the folder “CS, Multimedia, Books, Private, Programs & Utilities, Science and Temp”.
